== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What do you get with the free version of McAfee SECURE certification? =

Once your site is certified, the McAfee SECURE trustmark will display on your website, which lets your customers know the site they're on is part of the SECURE web. With the free service, the first 500 visitors/month will see the trustmark. After your site reaches the 500 visitor limit, the trustmark will not be displayed for the remainder of the month. The trustmark will reappear at the beginning of the following month and your visitor count will start over at zero.

= How do you define 500 visitors? =

We define "visits" as anyone who engages in a session on your site at some point during the month. The session cookie is set for 24 hours. This means that the visitor needs to be idle for more than 24 hours to be counted as a "visitor" for a second time. At the beginning of each month, the visitor count will start back at 0. Each time you login to your account at mcafeesecure.com, you'll be able to see how visitors have seen the trustmark so far for that month.

= What is the trustmark? =

The McAfee SECURE trustmark lets website visitors know that a website has been tested and certified to meet our security standards. When a website is certified as secure, it can display the trustmark. When it no longer meets our standards, the trustmark vanishes until the standards are met.

= What does this plugin do that other WordPress security plugins don't do? =

The McAfee SECURE trustmark is designed to let internet users know which websites are certified as safe to use. Other security badges indicate whether or not sites have purchased additional levels of protection, including SSL certificates and privacy badges. Often times, a site will use multiple security products to certify and scan their site for different types of vulnerabilities. 

= Will the McAfee SECURE trustmark work with other Security plugins I have on my site? =

Yes. Often we require certified sites to have multiple layers of security including SSL certificates and perimeter and behind the firewall vulnerability scanning. In many cases, a website will have several security services in place along with McAfee SECURE certification.

= What is McAfee SECURE Certification Pro? =

[McAfee SECURE Certification Pro](https://www.mcafeesecure.com/pro) is the full version of the service. Our Pro plan includes all of the premium features of the McAfee SECURE service:

* Unlimited Visitors: With our Pro plan, an unlimited number of site visitors will see the trustmark. Whether you’re selling a dozen custom-made pieces of jewelry every quarter or thousands of t-shirts a week, every single visitor will see the trustmark.
* Search Highlighting: Your site will be highlighted as SECURE in Google, Yahoo and Bing search results.
* Customized Trustmarks: As a Pro user, you will be able to customize your trustmark to best fit in with your Shopify site. You can customize the size and verification options to fit the needs of your users. The certification trustmarks can remain visible to all site visitors as they navigate through your site, or it can remain in a fixed location.
* Engagement Trustmark: This is the newest feature within the McAfee SECURE service. Unlike the certification trustmark, the engagement trustmark stays in one spot. So whether that’s by a signup form or in the checkout of your sales flow, visitors will know they’re safe as soon as they look at an engagement area.

= How do I upgrade to Pro? =

Upgrading is easy! When you upgrade, your trustmark code stays exactly the same. [Login](https://www.mcafeesecure.com/user/) to your account and you'll have to option to [upgrade to Pro](https://www.mcafeesecure.com/pro). Once you select this option, you can make your first payment and set everything up in just a few minutes. (Note: you will need to add an additional snippet of code to your site in order to install the engagement trustmark. Don't worry: there are easy-to-follow directions on how to do this once you have completed the upgrade.)

= Why isn't the trustmark showing up on my site? =

The McAfee SECURE trustmark is temporarily revoked for any domain that fails to meet our security standards for over 72 hours. The McAfee SECURE trustmark mark is temporarily replaced with a transparent image. If this occurs, log in to your account and view your violations. As soon as we determine that the domain meets our requirements, the trustmark will reappear.
